/**
 * Native companion for [org.chimeramc.launcher.core.minecraft.MinecraftRuntimePreparer].
 *
 * `libgxcore.so` (a prebuilt, closed-source binary) hardcodes its JNI symbol for
 * `nativeSetupRuntime` to the upstream `org.levimc.launcher.core.minecraft.MinecraftRuntimePreparer`
 * path. During the rebrand the host class was moved to `org.chimeramc.launcher.core.minecraft`
 * without a levimc-side binding, so the symbol is dead. This retained bridge keeps the
 * prebuilt library's hardcoded JNI lookup working; the implementation forwards to the
 * renamed chimeramc object.


 * Keep this file in `org.levimc.launcher.core.minecraft` — do NOT rename/move it.
