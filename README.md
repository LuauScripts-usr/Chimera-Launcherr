## Introduction

Chimera Launcher is a lightweight, open-source Android launcher specifically designed for legitimate players of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (MCBE). It provides a flexible and user-friendly alternative to the standard Google Play installation, allowing you to manage multiple game versionsand extend functionality with external modules.

Chimera Launcher enables you to import your official Minecraft APK and run it directly without requiring system installation. The launcher supports loading external native modules to enhance gameplay, provides robust multi-version management with complete isolation between installations,and includes built-in tools for managing worlds, resource packs, skin packs, accounts, controllers,and launcher settings. Whether you're looking to organize different game versions, test modifications, or optimize your gaming experience, Chimera Launcher offers the flexibility you need. The repository also ships a full user guide(English and 简体中文, developer documentation, and Preloader API reference under `docs/`.

> **Project lineage:** This repository is a **fork of [LeviLauncher](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLauncher)** (also known as LeviLaunchroid, the Android companion in the [LeviMC](https://levimc.org) open-source Bedrock modding ecosystem). It inherits the LeviLauncher Preloader/native-mod architecture and `.levipack` packaging,and continues development as Chimera Launcher with its own branding, features,and maintenance..



### Key Features

- **APK Import & Installation-Free Launching** – Import your official Minecraft APK(XAPK or composed APK supported)and run it directly without system installation
- **Native Mod System (LeviMC Preloader)** – Load external native SO modules packaged as `.levipack`,with a Preloader input/output pipeline, hook installation, patches,and keyboard/gamepad input callbacks for developers(see `docs/api` and `examples/full-cpp-mod`)

- **Controller Support & Input Mapping** – Up to 5 profiles per controller type(Xbox,DualShock 4,DualSense,with button remapping,stick dead-zone tuning,sensitivity,and vibration toggle,applied live to gameplay
- **Content Management & Skin Packs** – Import,export,and back up worlds,resource packs,skin packs,and launcher data from one place,plus skin-pack management outside the game**
- **Custom Flat Worlds** – Craft preset or fully customized superflat worlds before the game even opens**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with Chimera Launcher installation, ensure that you have the official Minecraft Bedrock Edition app installed on your device from Google Play. This is required for Chimera Launcher to function properly.

### Installation Steps

1. Visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/LuauScripts-usr/Chimera-Launcherr/releases)and download the latest APK build
2. Open your device Settingsand navigate to Security or Applications
3. Enable"Unknown Sources" or "Allow installation from unknown sources" to permit APK installation
4. Locate the downloaded APK file using your file manager,and tap to install
5. Grant the necessary permissions when prompted during installation
6. Once installed, open Chimera Launcher from your application drawer

> **Important:** Chimera Launcher requires a legitimate, licensed copy of Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Do not use this launcherwith pirated or unauthorized versions of the game. Ensure your Minecraft license is validand properly linked to your Microsoft account..

## Development Setup

If you want to build Chimera Launcher from source or contribute to development, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- Android Studio (latest version recommended)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
- Android SDK with API level 28 or higher

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Chimera Launcher repository:


   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LuauScripts-usr/Chimera-Launcherr.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory in Android Studio
3. Allow Android Studio to download,and install required dependencies,and build tools
4. Wait for Gradle to complete the initial sync process..
5. Connect your Android device or start an emulator (API 28+)
6. Click the"Run" button in Android Studio to build,and deploy to your device
7. The app will launch automatically on successful build completion

> **Build Tip:** For faster builds during development, use `Build > Make Project` to compile incrementally instead of full rebuilds..

---

### Continuous Integration

Every push to `main` and every pull request automatically triggers a CI workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) that:

- Checks out the repository **with submodules** (the native Preloader/LibHttpClient code is fetched,so the full native build can run)
- Builds a debug APK with JDK 21 and Gradle 8.13 (via the existing wrapper,`./gradlew assembleDebug`)
- **Fails the run (and blocks/red-flags the PR)** if the build breaks — it never silently swallows errors
- Uploads the resulting APK as a workflow artifact, downloadable straight from the **Actions** tab

To grab the APK from a green run:

1. Open the **Actions** tab on the repository
2. Click the latest green **Build Debug APK** run
3. Scroll to the bottom and download the **app-debug-apk** artifact
4. Install it on your device (Android 9.0+/API 28+,
